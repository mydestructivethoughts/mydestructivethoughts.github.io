    “Sometimes people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them.”
    <br>
    <br>
    - John Green

        Writing isn't my forte. And to be honest with you, reader, I'd rather have chosen any other medium to explain the swirling abyss inside my head. Alas, I am untalented and cannot use these other methods. I know there's no one out there reading this.
    No matter how much I hope that someone will finally understand me and see a fraction of my pain, my happiness, my struggles, I know there is no one I know that could possibly hope to understand me.

        But god I needed this, needed some way of letting everything out. Crying doesn't help, it only reminds me how pathetic I am. I couldn't hope to ever tell anyone. I don't have friends, just people to laugh at me, not with me.
        Today wasn't a good day, not by a longshot. Over and over I was reminded of how much of a failure I am. To be honest with you, I don't know why I'm sad. Sadness and anger often accompany each other, at least for me, but not today. after all they're both the closest thing i have to friends.
