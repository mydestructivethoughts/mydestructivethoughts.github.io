     “I am broken. I am a fraud. I am impossible to love.”

    It's hard to define friendship. I mean, do  you ask one of your aquaintances if you are friends or does it come naturally? How do you know if you're best friends with someone? And anyway, most people aren't true to themselves or anyone around them.
    Ask yourself, would your closest friend sacrifice themselves for you? If the answer is no, I think it is necessary to rethink the transparancy of this friendship.

    I recently let someone go. It wasn't easy but it was necessary. I used to think I was loyal friend, that I'd die for a close friend. But I realize now that it means nothing to lose something for which you put such little value.
    It only really means something when it's important to you. I knew if I was to keep my belief that I was loyal, I'd have to distance myself from friends. For now, I've done it and this is the only way the harsh truth comes out.

    “Sometimes people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them.”

        Writing isn't my forte. And to be honest with you, reader, I'd rather have chosen any other medium to explain the swirling abyss inside my head. Alas, I am untalented and cannot use these other methods. I know there's no one out there reading this.
    No matter how much I hope that someone will finally understand me and see a fraction of my pain, my happiness, my struggles, I know there is no one I know that could possibly hope to understand me.

        But god I needed this, needed some way of letting everything out. Crying doesn't help, it only reminds me how pathetic I am. I couldn't hope to ever tell anyone. I don't have friends, just people to laugh at me, not with me.
        Today wasn't a good day, not by a longshot. Over and over I was reminded of how much of a failure I am. To be honest with you, I don't know why I'm sad. Sadness and anger often accompany each other, at least for me, but not today. after all they're both the closest thing i have to friends.
